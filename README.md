# Two games made in Python

This is a web page made to host two games; Hangman and a text adventure game, Escape from the Manor. I made this as I wanted to both make a hangman game that would allow people to choose different themes and potential difficulty within that (i.e. if know more about animals than city names then one is easier than the other). For the text adventure game, I wanted to make a choose your own adventure game with the mini game within that of fighting the monsters within the Manor as you try to escape.

## Features 

-__Hangman game__

    The game of hangman plays as follows: The user will be asked to choose their theme of words that they will play with, either from animals, cities and countries. Once chosen, the computer will then randomly choose a word from that list. The player then gets to guess either the letters of the word or the word itself and every wrong guess will build the hangman. If the player gets the right word, they'll win but if they guess incorrectly six times, they will lose and the correct word will be shown to them. Regardless of the result, the player will be given the option to play again if they so wish. 

-__Hangman animals list__ 

    This is the list that the player can choose at the start of the hangman game that will make it so that all the words will be in the theme of animals.

-__Hangman cities list__ 

    This is the list that the player can choose at the start of the hangman game that will make it so that all the words will be in the theme of cities.

-__Hangman countries list__ 

    This is the list that the player can choose at the start of the hangman game that will make it so that all the words will be in the theme of countries.
